For Lab 4, I have submitted three classes: DemandPaging, Frame, and Process.

The DemandPaging class is the main class. It reads the input and simulates demand paging and the
replacement algorithms.
The Process class creates process objects that are stored in a process list. The Frame class
creates frames/pages that are used to populate a frameTable array.

I wrote these scripts on IntelliJ. To run this program please open project on IntelliJ or
another text editor like Sublime. In the terminal, type: javac DemandPaging.java. The type java Banker insert-input-here.
The input must be valid or else the the exception will be caught and my program will print an error
messaged and exit.
